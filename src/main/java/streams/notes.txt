The Stream API is about providing an implementation of the map-filter-reduce algorithm to the JDK.

The Collections API stores and organize the data in the JVM memory, while the Stream API process this data in a
very efficient way

Two of the goals of the Stream API are to enable you to create more readable and expressive code and to give the
Java runtime some wiggle room to optimize your computations.


//THE MAP-FILTER-REDUCE ALGORITHM

Map step = transforming objects into another values.
Filter = Taking into account, only the objects that matches some criteria
Reduce = getting individual amounts into one amount;


A Stream is an object that references a sequence of another objects of the same type
